# API Key Navigation Fix - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Currently, when a user successfully adds and validates their API key in the Settings page, they are forced to manually refresh the page to navigate to the Dashboard. This creates a poor user experience and breaks the expected flow of the application. This feature will implement automatic navigation and state management to provide a seamless user experience after API key validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automatic Navigation After API Key Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be automatically redirected to the Dashboard after successfully validating my API key, so that I can immediately start using the application without manual page refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully validates their API key THEN the application SHALL automatically navigate to the Dashboard page
2. WHEN the API key validation is successful THEN the navigation state SHALL be updated to reflect the Dashboard as the active page
3. WHEN navigating to the Dashboard THEN the API key status indicator in the header SHALL show the correct active count
4. WHEN the automatic navigation occurs THEN it SHALL happen within 2 seconds of successful validation
5. WHEN the user is redirected to Dashboard THEN they SHALL see a success message confirming their API key was saved

### Requirement 2: Real-time State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application state to update immediately when I add an API key, so that all components reflect the current authentication status without requiring a page refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is successfully validated THEN the global application state SHALL be updated immediately
2. WHEN the application state changes THEN all components that depend on API key status SHALL re-render automatically
3. WHEN the API key state updates THEN the navigation buttons SHALL become enabled/disabled appropriately
4. WHEN multiple API keys are configured THEN the header status indicator SHALL show the correct count in real-time
5. WHEN the state updates THEN localStorage SHALL be synchronized with the application state

### Requirement 3: Enhanced User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback during and after API key validation, so that I understand what's happening and when the process is complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key validation is in progress THEN a loading indicator SHALL be displayed
2. WHEN validation is successful THEN a success message SHALL be shown before navigation
3. WHEN validation fails THEN an error message SHALL be displayed without navigation
4. WHEN automatic navigation is about to occur THEN a brief notification SHALL inform the user
5. WHEN the user arrives at the Dashboard THEN a welcome message SHALL confirm successful setup

### Requirement 4: Graceful Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle validation errors gracefully, so that I can retry or fix issues without losing my progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key validation fails THEN the user SHALL remain on the Settings page
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the error message SHALL be specific and actionable
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the user SHALL be informed and given retry options
4. WHEN validation times out THEN the user SHALL be notified and able to retry
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the application state SHALL remain consistent and not corrupt

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the new navigation behavior to work with my existing API keys and settings, so that my current setup is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads with existing valid API keys THEN navigation SHALL work normally
2. WHEN users have multiple API providers configured THEN navigation SHALL work for any valid key
3. WHEN users update existing API keys THEN the same automatic navigation SHALL occur
4. WHEN users delete API keys THEN the navigation state SHALL update appropriately
5. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL check existing API key validity and set navigation state accordingly

### Requirement 6: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a user, I want the API key validation and navigation to be fast and responsive, so that I don't experience delays in using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API key validation occurs THEN the response time SHALL be under 3 seconds for valid keys
2. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and under 500ms
3. WHEN state updates happen THEN UI components SHALL re-render within 100ms
4. WHEN multiple validations occur THEN previous requests SHALL be cancelled to prevent conflicts
5. WHEN the application is under load THEN navigation performance SHALL remain consistent
